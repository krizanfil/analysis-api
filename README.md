# yfinance-analysis-api

General free to use api which can be locally deployed by running the main.py file. It takes either a string ticker symbol
of a stock or a list of string tickers based on which request type you choose to use.

## Usage:
Usage is shown in the test files for both request types.


## TODO:
* Add more analysis models
* Add a React frontend with a way to make the api calls and results visualised by graphs made in ReactoChart or Chart.js


## Sadly i have stopped my work on this project because every once/two weeks the yfinance package stops working and so does my API. It is sad and this situation has me quite frustrated but i think if you want to you can take the code from the api it works quite nicely and can be nicely used with pandas/numpy to make some nice visualisations. :(
